**Dataset:** Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set

**Source:** UCI ML Repository

**About the Dataset:**
This dataset contains features extracted from the Messidor image set to predict whether an image contains signs of diabetic retinopathy or not. All features represent either a detected lesion, a descriptive feature of an anatomical part or an image-level descriptor.

**Approach**
A three-layer (input-hidden-output) multilayer perceptron or neural network was trained on this data. 10 different sets of hyperparameters were analysed with 20 random initialisations each by using 2-fold cross validation. ~66% Test accuracy was achieved.
